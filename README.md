responsive UI Framework

Tatemae is a personal custom UI framework I built to speed up my responsive web development process.
Its a compilation of all my web style and function components that I find common in web sites/applications. Feel free to use it!

It is built with HTML5/css3/scss/JS/jQuery/React.

React is necessary to mount the component features. Best used with a bundler (I use webpack.)
